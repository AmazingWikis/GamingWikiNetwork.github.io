The GWN is always looking for new wikis to join it either as [members]({{site.baseurl}}/members) or [affiliates]({{site.baseurl}}/affiliates). If you'd like to join, please inquire in our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/pCfH7uk9jh) or on the [JiggyWikki talk page here](https://banjokazooiewiki.com/wiki/Jiggywikki_talk:Gaming_Wiki_Network).

### Who can apply?
- Our members need to be independently-hosted wikis about video games.
- Our affiliates can be either:
    - Wikis about any subject (see SpongeBob Wiki).
    - Websites about video games (see PaRappa.party).

### Membership benefits
- The GWN has a [footer](https://banjokazooiewiki.com/wiki/Template:Gaming_Wiki_Network) which is featured on the main pages of our member wikis. The footer contains a link to each member wiki, including affiliates. Links like this from other websites can help with your [SEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization).
- We have a [Discord community](https://discord.com/invite/pCfH7uk9jh) where you can ask for help or share tips and tricks with fellow members and affiliates of the network.
- We also have a social media presence which we can use to share news about your wiki achievements!

Sound interesting? [Apply today](https://discord.com/invite/pCfH7uk9jh)!

### Not independent? No problem!
Is your wiki currently hosted by a wiki farm that does **NOT** allow for host migration? Is your wiki full of ads you didn't ask for? Are your users being served content unrelated to your wiki's subject matter? 

Don't worry, you're not alone! We've been there. Join our [community server](https://discord.com/invite/pCfH7uk9jh) to talk with people who have successfully gained independence of a controlling wiki host. Get tips and tricks on how to migrate your content and how to find new hosting. Don't wait, migrate!
