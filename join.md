If you'd like to join, please inquire in our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/pCfH7uk9jh) or on the [JiggyWikki talk page here](https://banjokazooiewiki.com/wiki/Jiggywikki_talk:Gaming_Wiki_Network).

- Our affiliates can be either:
    - Wikis about any subject (see SpongeBob Wiki).
    - Websites about video games (see PaRappa.party).

### Membership benefits
- The GWN has a [footer](https://banjokazooiewiki.com/wiki/Template:Gaming_Wiki_Network) which is featured on the main pages of our member wikis. The footer contains a link to each member wiki, including affiliates. Links like this from other websites can help with your SEO.
